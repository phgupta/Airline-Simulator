# Airline-Simulator (05/15)
Collaborated with a friend and wrote a program in C++ that calculates distance between cities, 
determines airport traffic, displays plane information, adds plane information and determines best plane. 
All functions are based on input files which contains each cityâ€™s information, such as airport abbreviation, latitude, 
longitude, population and state.
